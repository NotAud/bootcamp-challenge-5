## Usage

Workday Schedule Manager
Allows you to schedule out a day into 1 hour blocks. These scheduled blocks are color coordinated based on if they are a previous hour, current hour, or upcoming hour. You can save descriptions of what you need to do inside these blocks and return to the page at any time as the descriptions are saved locally. For convenience the current date is at the top, everyday the schedule is reset and when you save a notification is displayed.
